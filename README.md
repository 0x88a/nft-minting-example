## NFT Minting Solution
This is a small personal project; it demonstrates a simple implementation of Web3JS without the use of any frameworks such as React or NuxtJSm running alone in the browser. This project contains code that will: randomly generate an nft, mint the nft on the ethereum block chain as well as a Solidity Smart contract which works with the frontend.

## Can I see it in action?
Of course! Head to <a href="https://darklight.xyz" target="_blank"> darklight.xyz</a>, where the project is deployed (on the rinkeby testnet) and try it out for yourself! You can view your gull on opensea once you've minted it <a href="https://testnets.opensea.io/assets/0xd5b0bdcbf9bf1fadb2d57228ca4bd5b969839810/" target="_blank"> here </a>
